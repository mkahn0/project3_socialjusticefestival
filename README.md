# project3_socialjusticefestival

## project overview
This project involves creating a hypothetical festival event about a social cause of our choice. My social justice festival, Cancer Crushed, is partnering with American Cancer Society, aiming to educate and raise awareness about cancer and cancer prevention, detail the latest research in cancer prevention and medication, and to foster a sense of community between cancer patients, family, and interested individuals.<br><br>

I chose to promote the topic of cancer education because of how unspoken the topic is in today's society. Cancer is more prevelant than we suspect. Many of us are or may be affected by cancer, whether developing cancer ourselves or knowing someone who will. This festival supports all of these individuals by providing education, both about cancer itself but also about daily habits for cancer prevention, and by fostering a sense of community, among those who have cancer or have had cancer and also among caretakers, family, and friends, of those who have or have had cancer.
