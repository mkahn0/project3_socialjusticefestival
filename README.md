# project3_socialjusticefestival

## project overview
This project involves creating a hypothetical festival event about a social cause of our choice. My social justice festival, Cancer Crushed, is partnering with American Cancer Society, aiming to educate and raise awareness about cancer and cancer prevention, detail the latest research in cancer prevention and medication, and to foster a sense of community between cancer patients, family, and interested individuals.
